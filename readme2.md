Your urls.py file currently includes the following endpoints:

1Ô∏è‚É£ API Endpoints (Router-based)

These are registered with Django REST framework‚Äôs DefaultRouter, meaning they provide CRUD operations automatically.

Endpoint	ViewSet	Description
/api/products/	ProductViewSet	List and manage products (CRUD)
/api/categories/	CategoryViewSet	List and manage categories (CRUD)

2Ô∏è‚É£ HTML-Based Views (Template Views)

These endpoints render HTML templates for product management.

Endpoint	View	Description
/api/html/product/	product_list	Product List Page
/api/html/product/<int:product_id>/	product_detail	Product Detail Page
/api/html/product/edit/<int:pk>/	EditProductView	Edit Product Page (form-based)
/api/html/product/delete/<int:pk>/	DeleteProductView	Delete Confirmation Page
/api/html/product/add/	AddProductView	Add New Product Page

3Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Endpoints to Consider

If you need more functionality, consider adding:

‚úÖ Category Details by Slug

path("api/categories/<slug:slug>/", CategoryDetailView.as_view(), name="category-detail"),

This allows fetching a specific category by its slug.

‚úÖ Filter & Search Products

path("api/products/search/", ProductViewSet.as_view({"get": "list"}), name="product-search"),

This lets you filter products via query parameters like ?category=bedroom.

‚úÖ Product Image Upload
If your products require image uploads, consider:

path("api/products/<int:pk>/upload-image/", ProductViewSet.as_view({"post": "upload_image"}), name="upload-product-image"),

Summary of Next Steps

üîπ Do you need more CRUD endpoints? (e.g., PATCH, DELETE for specific items?)
üîπ Do you want category filtering in the product list view?
üîπ Do you need authentication for product management?

Let me know how you want to extend these! üöÄ
